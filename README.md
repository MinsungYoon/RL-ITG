## Learning-based Initialization of Trajectory Optimization for Path-following Problems of Redundant Manipulators (ICRA23)
The contents of each folder are as follows.
- pirl (path-wise IK using reinforcement learning): code related to reinforcement learning and behavior cloning to learn learning-based initializers (RL-ITG and BC-ITG)
- pirl_gazebo: Creates a 3-D occupancy grid map by randomly configuring the external environment
- pirl_msgs: consists of messages or services on ROS
- pirl_vae: variational autoencoder learning code for learning scene_encoding_vector
- torm (cloned from [link](https://github.com/cheulkang/TORM)): TORM planner and Greedy and Linear initializer baselines
