## Learning-based Initialization of Trajectory Optimization for Path-following Problems of Redundant Manipulators (ICRA23)
The contents of each folder are as follows.
- pirl (path-wise IK using reinforcement learning): code related to reinforcement learning and behavior cloning
- pirl_gazebo: Creates a 3-D occupancy grid map by randomly configuring the external environment
- pirl_msgs: consists of messages or services on ROS
- pirl_vae: variational autoencoder learning code for learning scene_encoding_vector
- torm: TORM planner and Greedy and Linear initializer baselines
